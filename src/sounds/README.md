# SOUNDS

By placing your sound here (.mp3, .ogg or .wav), it will be automatically imported in your project.
The name of your file will be used to name the variable that will contains your sound.

Example:
With a file `./bell.mp3`, you can access your model with `this.assets.sounds.bell`

You can also organize your sounds with different directories.
For example, `./sounds/any/path/to/bell.mp3` find its access with `this.assets.sounds.any.path.to.bell`
