# 3D FONTS

By placing your .json font here, it will be automatically imported in your project.
The name of your file will be used to name the variable that will contains your font.

Example:
With a file `./arial.json`, you can access your model with `this.assets.fonts.arial`

You can also organize your fonts with different directories.
For example, `./fonts/any/path/to/arial.json` find its access with `this.assets.fonts.any.path.to.arial`
